# lead-scoring1
X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, generates leads through website visits, online ads, and referrals. Users who show interest by filling out a form become leads. The sales team then nurtures these leads through calls and emails, aiming to convert them into paying customers. Currently, the lead conversion rate is around 30%, but only a fraction of leads become customers. To improve efficiency, X Education wants a predictive model that assigns lead scores based on conversion likelihood. The goal is to achieve an 80% conversion rate by prioritizing high-potential leads and optimizing the sales process.
